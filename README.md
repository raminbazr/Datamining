# Datamining
In this project, I implement feature engineering methods; drop excessive features, Categorical engineering, and removed the outliers. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) and Random forest importance are used for determining the importance of features. Finally, Normalization, training and test sets, and split data are implemented.
